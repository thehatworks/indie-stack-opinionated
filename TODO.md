## dependency upgrades
  - prisma to 4.0 when zod-prisma is cool w it
  - react to 18.0

## mistakes
  - bring back remix.init ideas... remove top section steps from readme, and recreate remix.init script in bin as an explicit help with scaffolding, make sure it inherits so i pull in future upstream changes...

\nfix double reload step in dev server with css...
\nlive reload for errors? remix upstream idea
